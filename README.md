# CMD-analysis
This project documents the analysis of Colour-Magnitude Diagrams (CMDs) conducted as part of an university assignment.

Data Acquisition:

Raw data was acquired from .fits files obtained using the PIRATE telescopes.
StarAlt, STScI, and other relevant software were employed to identify object visibility and assess observing conditions.
Vizier and Aladin were utilized to identify reference stars within the target star cluster.
Images were collected after ensuring suitable observing conditions were met.

Data Processing:

AstroimageJ software was used to filter and process the collected images.
.CSV files were generated from the processed images.
Data extraction and filtering were performed on the .CSV files.

Data Analysis:

The filtered data was used to plot Colour-Magnitude Diagrams.
